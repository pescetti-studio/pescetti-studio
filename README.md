# Ciao! 🐟

We’re a small collective, and we make things with bits :)

## Stuff
### Flip01 💾
- 🌱 We created [Flip01](https://github.com/pescetti-studio/Flip01-CPU), a **simple 8-bit CPU**, entirely from scratch.
- 💬 Along with it, we put together a **free**, [in-depth manual](https://medium.com/@biasolo.riccardo/flip01-a-simple-yet-versatile-8-bit-cpu-fc01c36d5922) to help newcomers understand how it all works: perfect for anyone getting into CPUs for the first time.
- 🔋 We also implemented Flip01 on an FPGA board ([FliPGA01](https://github.com/pescetti-studio/FliPGA01)) and wrote a [guide](https://medium.com/@crocilorenzo01/flipga01-a-simple-8-bit-cpu-on-a-fpga-db3e0fb82fe6) on how to get the most out of it.
- ❗ And there’s a lot more coming over the next few weeks.
